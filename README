DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM IF YOU CARE ABOUT SECURITY.

This program is a toy program to demonstrate creating
a PGP signature for a possibly large remote file, without
actually downlaoding it.

Usage:

* Install Go (weekly snapshot)

* Run ./server on the machine of your choice

* Run ./client -h to get help about options

* Run ./client -server http://remote.host:10022/hash /etc/issue

* Follow the instructions. You get issue.sig in the current directory.
